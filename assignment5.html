<article> 
<p style="font-size:larger"> Hello, My name is Francisco Ayapan and my favorite hobby is watching the Chicago Bears play football. They are my favorite team out of all major sports teams. They interest me because I have always lived in Chicago. The bears last season finished with a regular season record of 12-4 and made the playoffs for the first time since 2010. Unfortunately they were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round when they played the Philidelphia Eagles. I am confident in the bears to win alot of games again this season and win a superbowl. I cant wait to watch my favorite team play.
